//operators
//1. arithmetic operator: +,*,/,-, mod(module), **(exponent)
//2. Assignment operator: =, +=, *=, -=, /=
//3. comparison operator: <, >, ==, >=, <=, ===(value and data type), !==(not equal)
let a = 10;
let b = 10;
console.log(a !== b); // false
//4. logical operator: &&(and), ||(or), !(not)
//5. bitwise operator: &, |, ^(xor), ~, <<(left shift), >>(right shift)
//6. ternary operator: (condition) ? true : false
// Example: let result = (a > b) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
//7. typeof operator: to check data type
//switch case 
//8. delete operator: to delete object property
//9. void operator: to evaluate expression without returning value
//10. in operator: to check if property exists in object
//11. instanceof operator: to check if object is instance of constructor
//12. spread operator: to spread elements of array or object
//13. rest operator: to collect multiple elements into array
//14. nullish coalescing operator: ?? to check if value is null or undefined
//15. optional chaining operator: ?. to access nested object properties without checking if they exist
//16. destructuring assignment: to unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables
//17. template literals: to create strings with embedded expressions
//18. for..of loop: to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, etc.
//19. for..in loop: to iterate over enumerable properties of an object
//20. map() method: to create a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array
//21. filter() method: to create a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function
//22. reduce() method: to execute a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value
//23. find() method: to return the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function
//24. some() method: to test whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function
//25. every() method: to test whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function
//26. includes() method: to determine whether an array includes a certain value among its entries
//27. indexOf() method: to return the first index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present
//28. lastIndexOf() method: to return the last index at which a given element can be found in the array, or -1 if it is not present
//29. slice() method: to return a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included)
//30. splice() method: to change the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place
//31. concat() method: to merge two or more arrays
//32. join() method: to join all elements of an array into a string
