Key Features of JavaScript

Client-Side Scripting

JavaScript runs directly in the browser, enabling dynamic content and user interactions without needing to communicate with a server.

Lightweight and Interpreted Language

It does not require compilation; instead, the browser interprets the code at runtime, making development faster and easier.

Dynamic Typing

Variables are not bound to any specific data type; they can hold any type of data at different times during execution.

Object-Oriented Features

JavaScript supports object-based programming using prototypes rather than classical class-based inheritance.

First-Class Functions

Functions in JavaScript can be treated like variablesâ€”passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.

Event-Driven Programming

JavaScript responds to events like mouse clicks, key presses, and page loads, making it suitable for interactive applications.

Asynchronous Programming

JavaScript handles asynchronous operations using callbacks, Promises, and async/await, allowing non-blocking code execution.

Prototype-Based Inheritance

Instead of classical inheritance, JavaScript uses prototype chains to inherit properties and methods from other objects.

Cross-Platform Compatibility

JavaScript works seamlessly across all major web browsers and operating systems, making it highly portable.

Rich Built-In Library

Offers a wide range of built-in objects (like Math, Date, Array, etc.) and methods for handling common programming tasks.

DOM Manipulation

JavaScript can access and modify HTML and CSS through the Document Object Model (DOM), enabling dynamic webpage updates.

Extensive Ecosystem and Community Support

A vast number of frameworks and libraries (like React, Angular, Vue) enhance its functionality, supported by a large developer community.
